Data is [available on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
## About the Model:
Logistic Regression Model is used from scikit learn and implemented on the data set.
Model has an accuracy of around 98%
# Evaluation of Predictions:
Model predictions has been evaluated with the actual values of the data using scikit learn's "Accuracy Score" method.

Model predictions and actual values has been compared with each other using matplotlib library
